#C Primer Plus - Chapter 2 Exercises and Solutions

This repository contains the Listings, Exercises, and solutions
for Chapter 2 of C Primer Plus, 5th edition, by Stephen Prata, 
which introduces Comments, Declarations, Data Types, Operators, 
Functions, Assignments, Errors, and Keywords. 

I created this repository for two reasons. First, I wanted to
incorporate Git and GitHub into my workflow, so I could give
myself an opportunity to practice the technologies. Second, I
wanted to show my work. That is, I used C and Vim on a Fedora
36 system in a VirtualBox environment to create, use, and manage
directories and files as I work through Prata's C Primer Plus
textbook. 

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions
or comments. In addition, feel free to utilize the solutions
for your consumption and edification.

Technical Notes and Considerations
--------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile and execute the Chapter 2 files,

    (1) copy the code and paste it directly into your preferred
        Integrated Development Environment (IDE), CLion, CodeLite,
        or Code::Blocks, for example, or your preferred text editor,
        Vim, Nano, or Emacs, for example,
    (2) and either build and run the files in your IDE
    (3) or use the following command-line scripts:

            $ gcc file_name.c -o main
            $ ./main
